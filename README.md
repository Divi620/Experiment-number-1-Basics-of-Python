# TITLE: Experiment number 2: Basics of Python
## **AIM:** To learn the basics of Python programming 
## **APPARATUS:** Google Collab, Github

# **_1. INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON_**
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It was developed by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python is known for its simple syntax and readability, which makes it easy to learn for beginners.
Python does not require complex syntax rules, making programs shorter and easier to understand compared to other programming languages. It is an interpreted language, meaning the code is executed line by line, which helps in easy debugging.
Python is widely used in engineering fields such as electronics, communication systems, automation, artificial intelligence, data science, embedded systems, and Internet of Things (IoT).

# 2. FEATURES OF PYTHON ✨

Easy to learn and use, Python is designed in a way that beginners can quickly understand and start writing programs. It has a simple and readable syntax, which makes programs easy to read and maintain. Python is free and open-source, allowing users to download, use, and modify it without any cost. It is an interpreted language, meaning the code is executed line by line, which helps in easy debugging. Python is portable and can run on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, and macOS without modification. It supports object-oriented programming, which helps in organizing code using classes and objects. Python also provides a large standard library that includes built-in modules and functions for various tasks, reducing the need to write code from scratch.

# 3. APPLICATIONS OF PYTHON 🚀

Python is used in many areas of engineering and technology. It plays an important role in software development for building applications and tools. Python is widely used in signal processing for analyzing and processing signals. In embedded systems, Python helps in controlling hardware and developing system-level applications. It is also used for automation and scripting to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. Python is popular in data analysis and visualization for handling and presenting large amounts of data. In the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Python is used to develop intelligent systems and models. Python is also used in web development for creating websites and web applications, and in IoT applications for developing smart and connected systems.

# 4. VARIABLES 🧮

A variable is a name used to store data in the memory of a computer. Variables allow us to store values and use them later in a program. In Python, there is no need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The data type is automatically assigned based on the value stored in the variable.

While naming variables, certain rules must be followed. A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore. It should not begin with a number. Spaces are not allowed in variable names. Reserved keywords of Python cannot be used as variable names.

# 5. DATA TYPES 📊

Data types define the type of data stored in a variable. Python supports several built-in data types. Integer data type is used to store whole numbers. Float data type is used to store decimal or fractional numbers. String data type is used to store text or characters. Boolean data type is used to store logical values such as True or False.

Understanding data types is very important because they determine the type of operations that can be performed on data in a program.

# 6. INPUT AND OUTPUT 🔄

Input refers to the process of taking data from the user during the execution of a program. Output refers to displaying results or information on the screen. Input and output operations make programs interactive and allow users to communicate with the system easily.

# 7. OPERATORS ➗

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Relational operators are used to compare two values and return a True or False result. Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.

## _CONCLUSION_
Python is an ideal language for beginners. Learning Python basics helps students build a strong foundation for advanced engineering applications and programming subjects.
